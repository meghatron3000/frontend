# FrontEnd
The front end was made using a combination of React.js and css. It has been bundled up in order to enable a faster loading time. 
## Things to fix
	* When click on logo or "StudyBuddy" it takes you back to the home page
	* When you click on any of the pictures it will take you to a page with more details of what was described in the pic.
	* The home screen will be more filled - maybe make it a scrolling homescreen instead of having a navigation bar
	* Debating if we should change the placement of the logo
	* Create a study buddy email or something
